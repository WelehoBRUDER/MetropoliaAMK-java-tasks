# a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?
Because you can't re-use events since they may not be resolved yet.  
It also needs to be linked to the timeline correctly, which is automatic  
if the new event is generated with default properties.

#  b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?
The arrival event, since it leads to a chain of continuing events.
