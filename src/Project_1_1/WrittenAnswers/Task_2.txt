A supermarket gets many kinds of customers at random intervals.
These customers might all want different things. Logistics networks are needeed
to get supplies to the store where they can be sold. Cashiers serve customers
as fast as they can, but time spent at the counter is dependent on the customer's order size.
Self-checkouts can potentially serve customers faster, but they are reliant on the customer.

There needs to be a queue to the checkouts, where customers decide if they want
service from a cashier or to serve themselves with the self-checkout.
Cashiers can serve only one customer at a time, and the service time varies wildly.
Self-checkouts can also serve only one customer, and the service time varies wildly.
