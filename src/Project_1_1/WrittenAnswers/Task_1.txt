Simulation can be better than real world experiments,
because on a broad scale it is far more cost-efficient in terms of resources.
Simulations can be run on a large scale in a very small amount of time, using only electricity.
For example; in a real world situation, gathering enough data for analysis takes time and resources.
It is also affected by real world conditions that may hinder the data gathering process.
Simulations in contrast are not affected by conditions outside and allow for larger amounts of data
to be generated in a fraction of the time. The downside of simulation is that while the resources needed for it
may be fewer in cost than real world data gathering, the pollution indirectly caused by
data centers consuming large amounts of energy happens to be quite damaging to the environment.
This can be mitigated by programming the simulation as efficiently as possible (eg .using a language lower level language)
and organizing it in such a way to use fewer servers.
