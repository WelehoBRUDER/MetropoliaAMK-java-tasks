# 1000 Ages
I would solve this problem by generating ages based on a weighted random algorithm.  
Each age in the distribution is assigned a weight corresponding to its prevalence.  
Thus, the resulting numbers should be correctly distributed.  
  
In order to model this simulation closely with reality, a census should be performed.  
As performing one is not within the requirements of this task, the program will instead assume ages.
