# Metropolia AMK Java Learning Tasks
This repository holds all Java learning tasks I have finished in Metropolia AMK.  
All answers are public and available for referencing.

## How are the tasks organized?
The usual standard I use is src -> module -> task -> java classes  
The first few tasks do not follow this template as I was still experimenting.
An example would be: src/Module_2_2/Task_1/GroceryListManager.java

## If you're a student, don't just copy my answers
You most likely won't learn much from just copying and pasting my answers to your work.  
You can use this repo as a reference/guide or to see how I've approached a problem.  
The most important thing is to learn how and why things work the way they do.
